  <p class="lead">
    Dr. Ulf Schiller is a new faculty member of the Department of
    Materials Science and Engineering at Clemson University. He
    studied Computer Science and Physics at the University of
    Bielefeld, Germany, and obtained his PhD from the Johannes
    Gutenberg University Mainz and the Max Planck Institute for
    Polymer Research working on lattice Boltzmann simulations of
    complex fluids and soft matter. Following his PhD, Schiller was
    awarded a Fellowship in Computational Sciences from Volkswagen
    Stiftung. After postdoctoral stays at the University of Florida
    and Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany, he joined the Centre for
    Computational Science at University College London, UK, where he
    maintains a visiting affiliation. Dr. Schiller's research
    interests cover a range of topics in computational soft matter and
    bio-inspired materials. He is particularly interested in
    elucidating, by means of computer simulations, how complex
    multiscale phenomena give rise to macroscopic materials
    properties. Dr. Schiller has extensive experience in developing
    novel scale-bridging algorithms and state-of-the-art simulation
    techniques. He contributed the first parallel lattice Boltzmann
    implementation to the ESPResSo software package and is a regular
    lecturer at the CECAM sponsored ESPResSo summer schools. At
    Clemson, Dr. Schiller intends to leverage the high performance
    computing capabilities of the Palmetto cluster and engage his
    students in the vibrant field of computational materials science.
