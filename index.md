Dr. Ulf Schiller is a new faculty member of the Department of
Materials Science and Engineering at Clemson University. He studied
Computer Science and Physics at the University of Bielefeld, Germany,
and obtained his PhD from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and
the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research working on lattice
Boltzmann simulations of complex fluids and soft matter. Following his
PhD, Schiller was awarded a Fellowship in Computational Sciences from
Volkswagen Stiftung. After postdoctoral stays at the University of
Florida and Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany, he joined the Centre
for Computational Science at University College London, UK, where he
maintains a visiting affiliation. Dr. Schiller's research interests
cover a range of topics in computational soft matter and bio-inspired
materials. He is particularly interested in elucidating, by means of
computer simulations, how complex multiscale phenomena give rise to
macroscopic materials properties. Dr. Schiller has extensive
experience in developing novel scale-bridging algorithms and
state-of-the-art simulation techniques. He contributed the first
parallel lattice Boltzmann implementation to the ESPResSo software
package and is a regular lecturer at the CECAM sponsored ESPResSo
summer schools. At Clemson, Dr. Schiller intends to leverage the high
performance computing capabilities of the Palmetto cluster to aid the
design of new materials through computational science.
