Dr. Ulf Schiller is a new faculty member of the Department of
Materials Science and Engineering at Clemson University. He
studied Computer Science and Physics at the University of
Bielefeld, Germany, and obtained his PhD from the Johannes
Gutenberg University Mainz and the Max Planck Institute for
Polymer Research working on lattice Boltzmann simulations of
complex fluids and soft matter. Following his PhD, Schiller was
awarded a Fellowship in Computational Sciences from Volkswagen
Stiftung. After postdoctoral stays at the University of Florida
and Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Germany, he joined the Centre for
Computational Science at University College London, UK, where he
maintains a visiting affiliation. Dr. Schiller's research
interests cover a range of topics in computational soft matter and
bio-inspired materials. He is particularly interested in
elucidating, by means of computer simulations, how complex
multiscale phenomena give rise to macroscopic materials
properties. Dr. Schiller has extensive experience in developing
novel scale-bridging algorithms and state-of-the-art simulation
techniques. He contributed the first parallel lattice Boltzmann
implementation to the ESPResSo software package and is a regular
lecturer at the CECAM sponsored ESPResSo summer schools. At
Clemson, Dr. Schiller intends to leverage the high performance
computing capabilities of the Palmetto cluster to aid the design of new materials through computational science.
